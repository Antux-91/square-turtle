**Antonio De Gaetano,**

a young professional with extensive experience in different jobs.

Often we ask ourselves, who we are and what we can do.

I can define myself as a Biologist, with a strong passion for Science and Technology. A person with a strong personality, always ready to learn and improve.

I decided to open my website as a challenge for me and also a way to improve my presence online.



Thank you for reading, and I hope you will enjoy your experience on this website.

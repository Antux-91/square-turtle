Sometimes is very hard to leave a country. I am living in the UK since the 2015, and in these last years I have seen many of the changes that affected this country in many ways. 

I have decided to move elsewhere, this decision came across my mind in the last weeks, when after faced for two years with a strong controversy, this has finished and now I need a little stress relief. 

I decided to move to Greece, where I could h ave a little working holiday. I could start to have a proper new experience. 

But sometimes, we got signs from someone who tell us to don't go. 

This is happened at the gate, where I have been stopped and sent back to my UK Home Town, this in relation with the strong controversy. Hopefully, this is ended once for all. 



And now a new start in England? 

We will see.
